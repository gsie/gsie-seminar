excerpt: "Since the end of the Cold War the number of Economic integration agreements has exploded. Trade agreements between unlikely partners question purely economic motivations — geopolitical considerations are likely to play an important role."

Economic determinants of economic integration agreements (EIAs) have received ample attention in the economic literature. While political motivations for such agree- ments have received less focus, the economic and the political science literature have established connections between trade policy and domestic politics, as well as with the incidence of conflict, supporting the so-called liberal peace hypothesis: Trading countries become interdependent, generating higher costs for mutual conflict, where EIAs can institutionalize such dependencies and foster peace.In this paper I suggest a different, less romantic narrative: trade policy, in the form of EIAs, is used as an instrument of foreign policy, enabling political influence. This delivers an alternate explanation for the vast increase in the number of EIAs over the past two decades, in which previously hegemonic and newly emerging powers fight for influence with more peaceful means.In a two-step approach I show that non-realized trade gains can be explained by political variables. I construct an index of depth of EIAs and estimate a modified gravity equation in order to calculate traditional trade gains. Using data on political events, their impact, participants and location, I further construct two variables that quantify the bilateral political relationship of a country pair. Finally, I estimate the effect of political motivations on a country’s trade policy and find evidence for the hypothesis that there is more to economic integration than “just trade”. Geopolitical considerations play a determining role in the choice of the contracting partner coun- try and the depth of the subsequent agreement, in particular when large economic asymmetries between bilateral partners exist.
