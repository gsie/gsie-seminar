The GSIE Seminar and Blog aim to provide a platform for PhD students and recent graduates in International Economics to present their research and receive feedback from other students and researchers. While primarily established for students at the [Paris School of Economics](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu) and [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](http://www.univ-paris1.fr), we gladly welcome presentations and blog contributions by students from other institutions.

The GSIE Seminar is jointly organized by [Matthieu Crozet](http://ces.univ-paris1.fr/membre/crozet/matthieu.htm) and [Thierry Verdier](http://www.pse.ens.fr/verdier/) with the assistance of [Elsa Leromain]() and [Julian Hinz](http://www.julianhinz.com).
The GSIE Blog is maintained by [Julian Hinz](http://www.julianhinz.com) and [Elsa Leromain]().

If you're interested in presenting your paper in the seminar or want to contribute a post to the blog, send a draft of your paper to [gsieseminar@gmail.com](mailto:gsieseminar@gmail.com).
